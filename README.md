# Health-Analytics-Dashboard-
I recently created a Health Analytics Dashboard focused on OCD patient trends, using real-world-style data to uncover insights around diagnosis patterns, symptom types, and demographics. This project demonstrates how analytics can support clinical insights, operational planning, and strategic decision-making.

Key Insights Delivered:

📅 Diagnosis volume month-over-month (MoM) for early detection patterns

👥 Gender-based comparison of obsession scores and diagnosis rates

🌍 Ethnicity-based trends to highlight demographic disparities

🧠 Most frequent obsessions and compulsions with severity scores

🛠️ Technical Stack:

SQL – Used to extract & manipulate data across multiple queries

Power BI – For visual storytelling and dynamic filtering

Excel – To validate calculations and support ad-hoc analyses

DAX & Power Query – To build custom measures and clean the data

🎯 What It Demonstrates:

BI skillset to drive actionable insights for healthcare, product, and operations teams

Experience aligning data governance with real-world reporting needs

Strength in turning complex datasets into executive-friendly dashboards

Passion for leveraging analytics to support patient-centric care and strategic goals
